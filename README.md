# IBB_Assignment3
Third assignment for Image-Based Biometry. All of the data is from AWE data set.

## Requirements

This assignment was made in Matlab with the following toolboxes:

* Deep Learning Toolbox
* Computer Vision Toolbox

## Running the program

I would recommend running only the testRecCNN.m program since it is used for testing the data. I wouldn't recommend running the trainRecCNN.m since it might take some time to complete. But feel free to check out the code. The .mat files are just used so the training part of the program does not have to be run everytime. 

You don't need to download the folders (they are used for training) although .mat files are needed for testing.

When running the program you will be asked to type 1, 2 or 3 depending on what type of recognition you want.
